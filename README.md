gradx
=====

A gradient selector and modifier tool 

gradx requires jQuery . 

if jQuery UI is not present you need to include the file draggable.js otherwise
gradX will automatically use the jQuery UI's draggable method

How to use:

You need to have a div where gradX will be loaded 

for eg. 

<div id='load_here'></div>


Then initiate gradx this way
gradX("#load_here");

Note: gradx only supports id here.

Look at demo.html for a complete example

dom-drag.js
